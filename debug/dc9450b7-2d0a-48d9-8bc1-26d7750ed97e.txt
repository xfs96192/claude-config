You cannot rationalize your way out of this.\n</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>\n\n## How to Access Skills\n\n**In Claude Code:** Use the `Skill` tool. When you invoke a skill, its content is loaded and presented to you—follow it directly. Never use the Read tool on skill files.\n\n**In other environments:** Check your platform's documentation for how skills are loaded.\n\n# Using Skills\n\n## The Rule\n\n**Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill might apply means that you should invoke the skill to check. If an invoked skill turns out to be wrong for the situation, you don't need to use it.\n\n```dot\ndigraph skill_flow {\n    \"User message received\" [shape=doublecircle];\n    \"About to EnterPlanMode?\" [shape=doublecircle];\n    \"Already brainstormed?\" [shape=diamond];\n    \"Invoke brainstorming skill\" [shape=box];\n    \"Might any skill apply?\" [shape=diamond];\n    \"Invoke Skill tool\" [shape=box];\n    \"Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'\" [shape=box];\n    \"Has checklist?\" [shape=diamond];\n    \"Create TodoWrite todo per item\" [shape=box];\n    \"Follow skill exactly\" [shape=box];\n    \"Respond (including clarifications)\" [shape=doublecircle];\n\n    \"About to EnterPlanMode?\" -> \"Already brainstormed?\";\n    \"Already brainstormed?\" -> \"Invoke brainstorming skill\" [label=\"no\"];\n    \"Already brainstormed?\" -> \"Might any skill apply?\" [label=\"yes\"];\n    \"Invoke brainstorming skill\" -> \"Might any skill apply?\";\n\n    \"User message received\" -> \"Might any skill apply?\";\n    \"Might any skill apply?\" -> \"Invoke Skill tool\" [label=\"yes, even 1%\"];\n    \"Might any skill apply?\" -> \"Respond (including clarifications)\" [label=\"definitely not\"];\n    \"Invoke Skill tool\" -> \"Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'\";\n    \"Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'\" -> \"Has checklist?\";\n    \"Has checklist?\" -> \"Create TodoWrite todo per item\" [label=\"yes\"];\n    \"Has checklist?\" -> \"Follow skill exactly\" [label=\"no\"];\n    \"Create TodoWrite todo per item\" -> \"Follow skill exactly\";\n}\n```\n\n## Red Flags\n\nThese thoughts mean STOP—you're rationalizing:\n\n| Thought | Reality |\n|---------|---------|\n| \"This is just a simple question\" | Questions are tasks. Check for skills. |\n| \"I need more context first\" | Skill check comes BEFORE clarifying questions. |\n| \"Let me explore the codebase first\" | Skills tell you HOW to explore. Check first. |\n| \"I can check git/files quickly\" | Files lack conversation context. Check for skills. |\n| \"Let me gather information first\" | Skills tell you HOW to gather information. |\n| \"This doesn't need a formal skill\" | If a skill exists, use it. |\n| \"I remember this skill\" | Skills evolve. Read current version. |\n| \"This doesn't count as a task\" | Action = task. Check for skills. |\n| \"The skill is overkill\" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |\n| \"I'll just do this one thing first\" | Check BEFORE doing anything. |\n| \"This feels productive\" | Undisciplined action wastes time. Skills prevent this. |\n| \"I know what that means\" | Knowing the concept ≠ using the skill. Invoke it. |\n\n## Skill Priority\n\nWhen multiple skills could apply, use this order:\n\n1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, debugging) - these determine HOW to approach the task\n2. **Implementation skills second** (frontend-design, mcp-builder) - these guide execution\n\n\"Let's build X\" → brainstorming first, then implementation skills.\n\"Fix this bug\" → debugging first, then domain-specific skills.\n\n## Skill Types\n\n**Rigid** (TDD, debugging): Follow exactly. Don't adapt away discipline.\n\n**Flexible** (patterns): Adapt principles to context.\n\nThe skill itself tells you which.\n\n## User Instructions\n\nInstructions say WHAT, not HOW. \"Add X\" or \"Fix Y\" doesn't mean skip workflows.\n\n\n</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>"

Check for skills. |\n| \"I need more context first\" | Skill check comes BEFORE clarifying questions. |\n| \"Let me explore the codebase first\" | Skills tell you HOW to explore. Check first. |\n| \"I can check git/files quickly\" | Files lack conversation context. Check for skills. |\n| \"Let me gather information first\" | Skills tell you HOW to gather information. |\n| \"This doesn't need a formal skill\" | If a skill exists, use it. |\n| \"I remember this skill\" | Skills evolve. Read current version. |\n| \"This doesn't count as a task\" | Action = task. Check for skills. |\n| \"The skill is overkill\" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |\n| \"I'll just do this one thing first\" | Check BEFORE doing anything. |\n| \"This feels productive\" | Undisciplined action wastes time. Skills prevent this. |\n| \"I know what that means\" | Knowing the concept ≠ using the skill. Invoke it. |\n\n## Skill Priority\n\nWhen multiple skills could apply, use this order:\n\n1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, debugging) - these determine HOW to approach the task\n2. **Implementation skills second** (frontend-design, mcp-builder) - these guide execution\n\n\"Let's build X\" → brainstorming first, then implementation skills.\n\"Fix this bug\" → debugging first, then domain-specific skills.\n\n## Skill Types\n\n**Rigid** (TDD, debugging): Follow exactly. Don't adapt away discipline.\n\n**Flexible** (patterns): Adapt principles to context.\n\nThe skill itself tells you which.\n\n## User Instructions\n\nInstructions say WHAT, not HOW. \"Add X\" or \"Fix Y\" doesn't mean skip workflows.\n\n\n</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>"

For all other skills, use the 'Skill' tool:**\n\n---\nname: using-superpowers\ndescription: Use when starting any conversation - establishes how to find and use skills, requiring Skill tool invocation before ANY response including clarifying questions\n---\n\n<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>\nIf you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke the skill.\n\nIF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.\n\nThis is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.\n</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>\n\n## How to Access Skills\n\n**In Claude Code:** Use the `Skill` tool. When you invoke a skill, its content is loaded and presented to you—follow it directly. Never use the Read tool on skill files.\n\n**In other environments:** Check your platform's documentation for how skills are loaded.\n\n# Using Skills\n\n## The Rule\n\n**Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill might apply means that you should invoke the skill to check.
