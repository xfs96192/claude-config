Don't adapt away discipline.\n\n**Flexible** (patterns): Adapt principles to context.\n\nThe skill itself tells you which.\n\n## User Instructions\n\nInstructions say WHAT, not HOW. \"Add X\" or \"Fix Y\" doesn't mean skip workflows.\n\n\n</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>"

Check for skills. |\n| \"I need more context first\" | Skill check comes BEFORE clarifying questions. |\n| \"Let me explore the codebase first\" | Skills tell you HOW to explore. Check first. |\n| \"I can check git/files quickly\" | Files lack conversation context. Check for skills. |\n| \"Let me gather information first\" | Skills tell you HOW to gather information. |\n| \"This doesn't need a formal skill\" | If a skill exists, use it. |\n| \"I remember this skill\" | Skills evolve. Read current version. |\n| \"This doesn't count as a task\" | Action = task. Check for skills. |\n| \"The skill is overkill\" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |\n| \"I'll just do this one thing first\" | Check BEFORE doing anything. |\n| \"This feels productive\" | Undisciplined action wastes time. Skills prevent this. |\n| \"I know what that means\" | Knowing the concept ≠ using the skill. Invoke it. |\n\n## Skill Priority\n\nWhen multiple skills could apply, use this order:\n\n1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, debugging) - these determine HOW to approach the task\n2. **Implementation skills second** (frontend-design, mcp-builder) - these guide execution\n\n\"Let's build X\" → brainstorming first, then implementation skills.\n\"Fix this bug\" → debugging first, then domain-specific skills.\n\n## Skill Types\n\n**Rigid** (TDD, debugging): Follow exactly. Don't adapt away discipline.\n\n**Flexible** (patterns): Adapt principles to context.\n\nThe skill itself tells you which.\n\n## User Instructions\n\nInstructions say WHAT, not HOW. \"Add X\" or \"Fix Y\" doesn't mean skip workflows.\n\n\n</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>"}}
