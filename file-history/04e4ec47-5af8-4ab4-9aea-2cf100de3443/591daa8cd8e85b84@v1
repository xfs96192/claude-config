# Plan: Generate Detailed README Documents

## Context
User needs two comprehensive README files that are detailed enough for an AI to fully reproduce both projects from scratch.

## Deliverables

### 1. `/Users/fanshengxia/Desktop/周报V2/README.md` - Main Weekly Report Project
Covers the complete automated weekly report generation system including:
- Project overview & architecture
- Complete file inventory with descriptions
- Data directory structure
- Configuration guide (config.py)
- Pipeline execution flow (5 steps)
- Each script's purpose, inputs, outputs
- Data format specifications
- Business logic rules
- External dependencies (Wind API, DeepSeek, LibreOffice)
- NAV caching system
- AI integration details
- VBA/Excel/Word automation
- Known limitations
- Step-by-step reproduction guide

### 2. `/Users/fanshengxia/Desktop/周报V2/README_DASHBOARD.md` - Web Dashboard Project
Covers the interactive HTML dashboard generator including:
- Overview & features
- Architecture (Python generation + client-side JS)
- 20 sections configuration
- CSS design system (dark theme, variables)
- JavaScript functionality (upload, export, search, sort, heatmaps)
- Data format (JSON structure)
- Sheet name normalization (Kangxi radicals)
- Number formatting rules
- Print/PDF export CSS
- Reproduction guide

## Approach
- Write in Chinese (matching the project's primary language) with technical terms in English
- Include actual code snippets and configuration examples
- Include data flow diagrams using ASCII art
- Make each README self-contained for AI reproduction
