Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\ndomains or tasks—they transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Concise is Key\n\nThe context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Claude needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.\n\n**Default assumption: Claude is already very smart.** Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \"Does Claude really need this explanation?\" and \"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\"\n\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\n\n### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\n\nMatch the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:\n\n**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.\n\n**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.\n\n**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.\n\nThink of Claude as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\n│   │   └── description: (required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md (required)\n\nEvery SKILL.md consists of:\n\n- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that Claude reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.\n- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).\n\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n\n##### References (`references/`)\n\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.\n\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\n\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.\n\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Claude to use files without loading them into context\n\n#### What to Not Include in a Skill\n\nA skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including:\n\n- README.md\n- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md\n- QUICK_REFERENCE.md\n- CHANGELOG.md\n- etc.\n\nThe skill should only contain the information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand. It should not contain auxilary context about the process that went into creating it, setup and testing procedures, user-facing documentation, etc. Creating additional documentation files just adds clutter and confusion.\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)\n\n#### Progressive Disclosure Patterns\n\nKeep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit. When splitting out content into other files, it is very important to reference them from SKILL.md and describe clearly when to read them, to ensure the reader of the skill knows they exist and when to use them.\n\n**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details (patterns, examples, configuration) into separate reference files.\n\n**Pattern 1: High-level guide with references**\n\n```markdown\n# PDF Processing\n\n## Quick start\n\nExtract text with pdfplumber:\n[code example]\n\n## Advanced features\n\n- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide\n- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods\n- **Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns\n```\n\nClaude loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.\n\n**Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization**\n\nFor Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context:\n\n```\nbigquery-skill/\n├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)\n└── reference/\n    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)\n    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)\n    ├── product.md (API usage, features)\n    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)\n```\n\nWhen a user asks about sales metrics, Claude only reads sales.md.\n\nSimilarly, for skills supporting multiple frameworks or variants, organize by variant:\n\n```\ncloud-deploy/\n├── SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)\n└── references/\n    ├── aws.md (AWS deployment patterns)\n    ├── gcp.md (GCP deployment patterns)\n    └── azure.md (Azure deployment patterns)\n```\n\nWhen the user chooses AWS, Claude only reads aws.md.\n\n**Pattern 3: Conditional details**\n\nShow basic content, link to advanced content:\n\n```markdown\n# DOCX Processing\n\n## Creating documents\n\nUse docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).\n\n## Editing documents\n\nFor simple edits, modify the XML directly.\n\n**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)\n**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)\n```\n\nClaude reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.\n\n**Important guidelines:**\n\n- **Avoid deeply nested references** - Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md.\n- **Structure longer reference files** - For files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top so Claude can see the full scope when previewing.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\nSkill creation involves these steps:\n\n1. Understand the skill with concrete examples\n2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\n3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)\n4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)\n5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py)\n6. Iterate based on real usage\n\nFollow these steps in order, skipping only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\n\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\n\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\n\n- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\n- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\n\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\n\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\n\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\n\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\n\nUsage:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>\n```\n\nThe script:\n\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n- Creates example resource directories: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`\n- Adds example files in each directory that can be customized or deleted\n\nAfter initialization, customize or remove the generated SKILL.md and example files as needed.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Claude to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Claude. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Claude instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n\n#### Learn Proven Design Patterns\n\nConsult these helpful guides based on your skill's needs:\n\n- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md for sequential workflows and conditional logic\n- **Specific output formats or quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md for template and example patterns\n\nThese files contain established best practices for effective skill design.\n\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\n\nAdded scripts must be tested by actually running them to ensure there are no bugs and that the output matches what is expected. If there are many similar scripts, only a representative sample needs to be tested to ensure confidence that they all work while balancing time to completion.\n\nAny example files and directories not needed for the skill should be deleted. The initialization script creates example files in `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` to demonstrate structure, but most skills won't need all of them.\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.\n\n##### Frontmatter\n\nWrite the YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:\n\n- `name`: The skill name\n- `description`: This is the primary triggering mechanism for your skill, and helps Claude understand when to use the skill.\n  - Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.\n  - Include all \"when to use\" information here - Not in the body. The body is only loaded after triggering, so \"When to Use This Skill\" sections in the body are not helpful to Claude.\n  - Example description for a `docx` skill: \"Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction. Use when Claude needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks\"\n\nDo not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter.\n\n##### Body\n\nWrite instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources.\n\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n\nOnce development of the skill is complete, it must be packaged into a distributable .skill file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nOptional output directory specification:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\n```\n\nThe packaging script will:\n\n1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\n\n   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\n   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\n   - Description completeness and quality\n   - File organization and resource references\n\n2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a .skill file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.skill`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution. The .skill file is a zip file with a .skill extension.\n\nIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\n\n**Iteration workflow:**\n\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\n4. Implement changes and test again\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"73ce3c43-12f5-42be-a5bc-dc9fbf374d02","timestamp":"2026-02-13T03:37:13.335Z"}

209→关于 RQData 的一些基础知识\n   210→​\n   211→关于架构\n   212→​\n   213→\n   214→RQData 的基本架构为客户端——服务端模式，即数据存储在服务端，而客户端向服务端发送数据请求，服务端向客户端返回数据的模式。因此客户端被叫做rqdatac，这里c代表client，即客户端的意思。\n   215→\n   216→安装\n   217→​\n   218→\n   219→Rqdatac 的安装：\n   220→\n   221→sh\n   222→pip install rqdatac\n   223→\n   224→若您有 rqdatac_fund 和 rqdatac_news 包,请执行以下代码同时安装 rqdatac 和对应包 仅安装其中一个包，请将[]中名字换成您的包名\n   225→\n   226→sh\n   227→pip install \"rqdatac[fund]\"\n   228→\n   229→同时安装多个包\n   230→\n   231→sh\n   232→pip install \"rqdatac[fund,news]\"\n   233→RQData 初始化\n   234→​\n   235→\n   236→跟所有的 Python 包一样，如果要使用它，就必须导入它。使用 RQData 只需要在安装了 Ricequant SDK 的虚拟环境中运行 Python 代码，并在调用任何金融数据之前导入一个rqdatac的包。\n   237→\n   238→随后调用rqdatac.init()来对 RQData 进行初始化。在首次调用 RQData 的任何 API 之前都必须执行该语句，但例外的是如果您在 Ricequant SDK 环境下使用rqsdk shell命令调出的 iPython 环境不需要执行rqdatac.init()语句，而是import rqdatac之后可以直接调用其他 API。\n   239→\n   240→python\n   241→import rqdatac\n   242→rqdatac.init()\n   243→查看版本号及登录信息\n   244→​\n   245→\n   246→就像任何软件一样，RQData 也有它自己的版本号，可以通过下面的 API 检查当前的登录状态版本号：\n   247→\n   248→rqdatac.info\n   249→​\n   250→\n   251→获取用户当前登录版本、服务器信息\n   252→\n   253→返回\n   254→​\n   255→\n   256→rqdatac version: 当前使用的

来查看当前的流量使用情况。同时还能查看当前许可证的到期期限和许可证类型。\n   273→\n   274→客户端与服务端之间的传输协议为米筐为数据传输开发的二进制协议，并在传输时对数据进行了压缩，因此传输流量大概在实际数据量的三分之一左右。而米筐的流量配额是按实际传输流量来计算的，因此完全可以满足正常的甚至突发的使用情况。\n   275→\n   276→为避免影响正式的客户，RQData 对于试用账户进行了每天 1G 的配额限制。普通的限额账户在上述的压缩算法下，已经完全满足绝大部分的使用需求了。\n   277→\n   278→如果您对这些信息有任何疑虑，请立即联系我们的技术支持团队。\n   279→\n   280→rqdatac.user.get_quota - 获取用户配额信息\n   281→​\n   282→\n

API 中设计日期作为参数的非常多，因此对于日期格式的支持也非常丰富。具体支持见下表：\n   308→\n   309→格式描述\t格式示例\n   310→数字 YYYYDDMM\t20150101\n   311→字符串\"YYYY-DD-MM\"\t\"2015-01-01\"\n   312→datetime 对象\tdatetime.datetime (2015, 1, 3)\n

start_date=pandas.Timestamp(\"20150101\"), end_date=datetime.datetime(2015,2,1))\n   325→保存数据为 csv 文件\n   326→​\n   327→\n   328→通过 RQData API 返回的数据绝大部分为Pandas的DataFrame格式，方便您通过 Pandas 强大的 API 进行后续的分析工作。但是如果您已有用其他语言编写的投研工具，只是希望获得 RQData 中的原始金融数据，则可以通过下面的方法输出原始数据为 csv 文件：\n   329→\n   330→python\n   331→import rqdatac\n   332→rqdatac.init()\n   333→# get_price的返回值为Pandas.DataFrame类型，可以直接调用其to_csv接口\n   334→value = rqdatac.get_price('000001.XSHE', start_date=20150101, end_date=20150201)\n   335→value.to_csv('xxxx.csv')\n   336→RQData 内部的专有名词解释\n   337→​\n   338→rqdatac：RQData 客户端（即 RQData Client）。\n   339→rqdatad：RQData 服务端（即 RQData Daemon）。\n   340→order_book_id：这是米筐内部对于合约代码、股票代码、债券代号等指向某个金融产品实例的编号的统称。这是米筐为了兼容多市场而自定义的一个字段，它的取值在任何时间跨度内全局唯一。\n   341→快速上手\n   342→​\n   343→安装及配置\n   344→​\n   345→\n   346→RQData 的安装根据于您的使用方式也会有所不同。\n   347→\n   348→使用线上平台的 IPython Notebook 环境及回测环境\n   349→​\n   350→\n   351→不需要任何的安装或配置，而且所有的包已经预先导入，您无需使用前述的import rqdatac或rqdatac.init()，在使用 RQData API 时也无需添加rqdatac的前缀，可以直接使用，例如：\n   352→\n   353→python\n   354→get_price('000001.XSHE', start_date=20150101, end_date=20150201)\n   355→本地安装 RQData\n   356→​\n   357→\n   358→请参考Ricequant SDK 安装教程。在您完成 Ricequant SDK 的安装之后，您的环境里即可以使用 RQData。\n   359→\n   360→米筐也提供独立的 RQData 安装方式，请在申请试用或开通正式账户后查收米筐为您准备的安装指引邮件。米筐推荐使用 Ricequant SDK 的方式安装并管理 RQData 及其许可证信息。\n   361→\n   362→如果您在回测引擎 RQAlpha Plus 中使用 RQData，可以省略rqdatac.init()语句的调用。\n   363→\n   364→私有化部署的安装\n   365→​\n

并无二致，米筐技术支持会提供详细的安装帮助。\n   370→\n   371→开始使用\n   372→​\n   373→\n   374→前文已描述过 RQData 的安装及其在不同环境中的初始化过程，事实上所有的准备工作就已经就绪了。\n   375→\n   376→而使用 RQData 则异常简单，只需要直接调用您想要的 API 获取数据即可。具体的 API 使用示范都在 API 参考中列出。\n   377→\n   378→RQData 客户端rqdatac以框架+模块的形式提供了丰富的金融数据。你只需要在文档目录中找到相应的金融产品类型即可。但是在查阅具体金融产品类型之前，我们推荐您先浏览一下 RQData 的基础 API，也可在文档目录中找到相关链接，或直接点击这里。\n   379→\n   380→Last Updated: 11/3/25, 3:06 AM\n

API文档\n\n文档目录\n\n数据获取\n\n请求示例\n\n接口方法\n\nRQData 是一个基于 Python 的金融数据工具包。它为量化工程师们提供了丰富整齐的历史数据以及简单高效的 API 接口，最大限度地免除了您进行数据搜索、清洗的烦恼。这样的数据服务是整个 Ricequant SDK 的基础，取决于您的需求，它可以独立使用而不依赖 Ricequant SDK 的其他组件。\n\n关于 RQData 的一些基础知识\n​\n关于架构\n​\n\nRQData 的基本架构为客户端——服务端模式，即数据存储在服务端，而客户端向服务端发送数据请求，服务端向客户端返回数据的模式。因此客户端被叫做rqdatac，这里c代表client，即客户端的意思。\n\n安装\n​\n\nRqdatac 的安装：\n\nsh\npip install rqdatac\n\n若您有 rqdatac_fund 和 rqdatac_news 包,请执行以下代码同时安装 rqdatac 和对应包 仅安装其中一个包，请将[]中名字换成您的包名\n\nsh\npip install \"rqdatac[fund]\"\n\n同时安装多个包\n\nsh\npip install \"rqdatac[fund,news]\"\nRQData 初始化\n​\n\n跟所有的 Python 包一样，如果要使用它，就必须导入它。使用 RQData 只需要在安装了 Ricequant SDK 的虚拟环境中运行 Python 代码，并在调用任何金融数据之前导入一个rqdatac的包。\n\n随后调用rqdatac.init()来对 RQData 进行初始化。在首次调用 RQData 的任何 API 之前都必须执行该语句，但例外的是如果您在 Ricequant SDK 环境下使用rqsdk shell命令调出的 iPython 环境不需要执行rqdatac.init()语句，而是import rqdatac之后可以直接调用其他 API。\n\npython\nimport rqdatac\nrqdatac.init()\n查看版本号及登录信息\n​\n\n就像任何软件一样，RQData 也有它自己的版本号，可以通过下面的 API 检查当前的登录状态版本号：\n\nrqdatac.info\n​\n\n获取用户当前登录版本、服务器信息\n\n返回\n​\n\nrqdatac version: 当前使用的 rqdata 版本号\nserver address：域名:端口\n\n范例\n​\n获取用户登录信息\npython\n[In]\ninfo()\n[Out]\nrqdatac version: 2.6.0\nsever address: rqdatad-pro.ricequant.com:16011\nYou are using account: +86186XXXX6610\n流量配额\n​\n\n在非本地化部署的情况下，RQData 的每一次调用都需要从服务端拉取对应的数据，这些数据量将会产生流量。米筐为每日可拉取的最高流量做了限制，您可以通过下面的 API 来查看当前的流量使用情况。同时还能查看当前许可证的到期期限和许可证类型。\n\n客户端与服务端之间的传输协议为米筐为数据传输开发的二进制协议，并在传输时对数据进行了压缩，因此传输流量大概在实际数据量的三分之一左右。而米筐的流量配额是按实际传输流量来计算的，因此完全可以满足正常的甚至突发的使用情况。\n\n为避免影响正式的客户，RQData 对于试用账户进行了每天 1G 的配额限制。普通的限额账户在上述的压缩算法下，已经完全满足绝大部分的使用需求了。\n\n如果您对这些信息有任何疑虑，请立即联系我们的技术支持团队。\n\nrqdatac.user.get_quota - 获取用户配额信息\n​\n\n获取用户当前配额使用信息，目前可以提供的有今日已用流量、今日可用流量上限。\n\n返回\n​\n\ndict\n\n字段\t类型\t说明\nbytes_limit\tint\t每日流量使用上限（单位为字节），如为 0 则表示不受限\nbytes_used\tint\t当日已用流量（单位为字节）\nremaining_days\tint\t剩余期限（单位为天）\nlicense_type\tstr\t“TRIAL” 表示试用账户,“FULL” 表示付费用户\n范例\n​\n获取用户配额信息\npython\n[In]\nrqdatac.user.get_quota()\n\n[Out]\n{'bytes_limit': 0, 'bytes_used': 954'remaining_days': 16,'license_type': 'TRIAL'}\nAPI 中关于日期的格式支持\n​\n\nRQData 的 API 中设计日期作为参数的非常多，因此对于日期格式的支持也非常丰富。具体支持见下表：\n\n格式描述\t格式示例\n数字 YYYYDDMM\t20150101\n字符串\"YYYY-DD-MM\"\t\"2015-01-01\"\ndatetime 对象\tdatetime.datetime (2015, 1, 3)\ndate 对象\tdatetime.date (2015, 1, 3)\nPandas Timestamp\tpandas.Timestamp ('20150103')\n范例\n​\npython\nimport rqdatac, pandas, datetime\n\nrqdatac.init()\n\nrqdatac.get_price('000001.XSHE', start_date=20150101, end_date=\"2015-02-01\")\n\nrqdatac.get_price('000002.XSHE', start_date=pandas.Timestamp(\"20150101\"), end_date=datetime.datetime(2015,2,1))\n保存数据为 csv 文件\n​\n\n通过 RQData API 返回的数据绝大部分为Pandas的DataFrame格式，方便您通过 Pandas 强大的 API 进行后续的分析工作。但是如果您已有用其他语言编写的投研工具，只是希望获得 RQData 中的原始金融数据，则可以通过下面的方法输出原始数据为 csv 文件：\n\npython\nimport rqdatac\nrqdatac.init()\n# get_price的返回值为Pandas.DataFrame类型，可以直接调用其to_csv接口\nvalue = rqdatac.get_price('000001.XSHE', start_date=20150101, end_date=20150201)\nvalue.to_csv('xxxx.csv')\nRQData 内部的专有名词解释\n​\nrqdatac：RQData 客户端（即 RQData Client）。\nrqdatad：RQData 服务端（即 RQData Daemon）。\norder_book_id：这是米筐内部对于合约代码、股票代码、债券代号等指向某个金融产品实例的编号的统称。这是米筐为了兼容多市场而自定义的一个字段，它的取值在任何时间跨度内全局唯一。\n快速上手\n​\n安装及配置\n​\n\nRQData 的安装根据于您的使用方式也会有所不同。\n\n使用线上平台的 IPython Notebook 环境及回测环境\n​\n\n不需要任何的安装或配置，而且所有的包已经预先导入，您无需使用前述的import rqdatac或rqdatac.init()，在使用 RQData API 时也无需添加rqdatac的前缀，可以直接使用，例如：\n\npython\nget_price('000001.XSHE', start_date=20150101, end_date=20150201)\n本地安装 RQData\n​\n\n请参考Ricequant SDK 安装教程。在您完成 Ricequant SDK 的安装之后，您的环境里即可以使用 RQData。\n\n米筐也提供独立的 RQData 安装方式，请在申请试用或开通正式账户后查收米筐为您准备的安装指引邮件。米筐推荐使用 Ricequant SDK 的方式安装并管理 RQData 及其许可证信息。\n\n如果您在回测引擎 RQAlpha Plus 中使用 RQData，可以省略rqdatac.init()语句的调用。\n\n私有化部署的安装\n​\n\n将 RQData 的服务端rqdatad及其依赖的数据库部署到本地服务中以实现局域网环境低时延的访问体验，是 RQData 产品提供的私有化部署方案。如果您有这方面的需求，请联系我们的销售。\n\n私有化部署的服务端将由米筐工作人员为您完成，您只需要提供服务器的访问端口即可。而客户端的安装与互联网版本的 RQData 并无二致，米筐技术支持会提供详细的安装帮助。\n\n开始使用\n​\n\n前文已描述过 RQData 的安装及其在不同环境中的初始化过程，事实上所有的准备工作就已经就绪了。\n\n而使用 RQData 则异常简单，只需要直接调用您想要的 API 获取数据即可。具体的 API 使用示范都在 API 参考中列出。\n\nRQData 客户端rqdatac以框架+模块的形式提供了丰富的金融数据。你只需要在文档目录中找到相应的金融产品类型即可。但是在查阅具体金融产品类型之前，我们推荐您先浏览一下 RQData 的基础 API，也可在文档目录中找到相关链接，或直接点击这里。\n\nLast Updated: 11/3/25, 3:06 AM\n\nPager\nPrevious page\n文档目录\nNext

ETF、LOF\n可转债\t沪深市场合约\n中国期货\t包括股指、国债、商品期货\n中国期权\t包括 ETF、股指、商品期权\n国债逆回购\t沪深市场合约\n现货\t包括黄金、铂金、白银等\nRicequant 实时数据的频率包括\n​\n提供 Level1 tick 五档深度行情\n提供实时的 1 、3、5、15、30、60 等任意频率的分钟行情合成 （注：30、60 分钟线是按照时间进行切片。例如合约在 10:15-10:30 休市，则 60 分钟线在 11:00 只包含 45 分钟的交易；而 30 分钟线将出现 10:15 的时间戳）\nA、实时行情推送的适用场景\n​\n\n1、 驱动实盘交易或者模拟交易\n2、 若客户已有实时行情，米筐可以作为备份\n\nB、相较于 RQData 请求数据的优点\n​\n\n1、 推送会比拉取型 API 返回实时行情更及时，效率更高\n2、 提供 python sdk 和 websocket 网络接口，用户可以使用任意语言接入，语言中性\n3、 基于 ricequant 的数据能力和 rqdata 的基础设施，数据准确快速，可靠性高\n\nLiveMarketDataClient - websocket 实时行情推送方案\n​\n\n通过简单的一行代码从 RQData 引入

股财务数据\n​\n\n米筐科技（RiceQuant）基于量化交易的实际投资研究需求，对财务数据建立了一套完整的上市公司财务数据处理流程。米筐科技的财务数据有如下优点：\n\n对三大表（资产负债表、现金流量表、利润表）原生财务数据实现自动化清洗检查入库流程，及时发现异常数据，并基于上市公司公布财报进行人工核对\n自主实现超过 200 个衍生财务数据计算，并根据量化投研需求，分为估值衍生指标、经营衍生指标、现金流衍生指标、财务衍生指标、成长性衍生指标五类\n对原生及衍生财务数据均实现了 LF、LYR、TTM 三种计算逻辑，用户可根据实际需求，灵活选择合适的数据实现指标选股/因子构建/策略编写等量化投资研究流程\n计算过程中考虑历史数据实际公布时间点，严格避免未来数据，为因子/策略的检验回测提供严谨可靠的数据支持\n\n以下表格的字段全部基于新会计准则并直接采集于三大财报（资产负债表、利润表和现金流量表）。财报本身的来源常见有交易所的定期公告中的常规季报和年报、临时公告中的业绩快报和比较式财务报告以及招股说明书等。该部分数据一定来源于完整的财报，所以一般意义上的业绩快报，业绩预增报告中的数据并不会出现。\n\n\nget_pit_financials_ex

Reference/Guidelines** (best for standards or specifications)\n- Works well for brand guidelines, coding standards, or requirements\n- Example: Brand styling with \"Brand Guidelines\" → \"Colors\" → \"Typography\" → \"Features\"\n- Structure: ## Overview → ## Guidelines → ## Specifications → ## Usage...\n\n**4. Capabilities-Based** (best for integrated systems)\n- Works well when the skill provides multiple interrelated features\n- Example: Product Management with \"Core Capabilities\" → numbered capability list\n- Structure: ## Overview → ## Core Capabilities → ### 1. Feature → ### 2. Feature...\n\nPatterns can be mixed and matched as needed. Most skills combine patterns (e.g., start with task-based, add workflow for complex operations).\n\nDelete this entire \"Structuring This Skill\" section when done - it's just guidance.]\n\n## [TODO: Replace with the first main section based on chosen structure]\n\n[TODO: Add content here. See examples in existing skills:\n- Code samples for technical skills\n- Decision trees for complex workflows\n- Concrete examples with realistic user requests\n- References to scripts/templates/references as needed]\n\n## Resources\n\nThis skill includes example resource directories that demonstrate how to organize different types of bundled resources:\n\n### scripts/\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) that can be run directly to perform specific operations.\n\n**Examples from other skills:**\n- PDF skill: `fill_fillable_fields.py`, `extract_form_field_info.py` - utilities for PDF manipulation\n- DOCX skill: `document.py`, `utilities.py` - Python modules for document processing\n\n**Appropriate for:** Python scripts, shell scripts, or any executable code that performs automation, data processing, or specific operations.\n\n**Note:** Scripts may be executed without loading into context, but can still be read by Claude for patching or environment adjustments.\n\n### references/\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.\n\n**Examples from other skills:**\n- Product management: `communication.md`, `context_building.md` - detailed workflow guides\n- BigQuery: API reference documentation and query examples\n- Finance: Schema documentation, company policies\n\n**Appropriate for:** In-depth documentation, API references, database schemas, comprehensive guides, or any detailed information that Claude should reference while working.\n\n### assets/\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.\n\n**Examples from other skills:**\n- Brand styling: PowerPoint template files (.pptx), logo files\n- Frontend builder: HTML/React boilerplate project directories\n- Typography: Font files (.ttf, .woff2)\n\n**Appropriate for:** Templates, boilerplate code, document templates, images, icons, fonts, or any files meant to be copied or used in the final output.\n\n---\n\n**Any unneeded directories can be deleted.** Not every skill requires all three types of resources.\n"},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"dfb40b66-c1b9-45f9-b1d9-2b48e04ba84c"}

Then I ran Python code to query the data. First attempt with '090007.OF' failed because the correct format is '090007' (without .OF suffix). I then searched for the correct code format and successfully queried the fund data, showing:\n- 1-year return: +1.91%\n- Latest net value data\n- Holdings data was unavailable\n\n**Message 4**: User said \"好的请调整skills 以后查询基金数据会自动调整格式或者校验，我问数据的情况你会帮我运作和得到数据\"\n\nThis is critical feedback - user wants:\n1. Auto-correct/validate fund code formats\n2. Automatically run queries and return actual data (not just code)\n\n**My Response 4**: I updated the SKILL.md to add:\n- Work flow section emphasizing must execute queries and return results\n- Code format validation and auto-correction rules\n- Created scripts/query_helper.py for normalizing codes\n\n**Message 5** (system reminder): User sent new message while working: \"基于这个skills和你对这个数据库的理解，总结这个数据库的调用方式，在我的桌面生成一个这个数据库的中文详细文档\"\n\nThis is the pending task - create a comprehensive Chinese documentation about the database on the Desktop.\n\n**Key Technical Details**:\n- RiceQuant rqdatac Python SDK\n- License-based authentication\n- Fund code format: pure numbers (e.g., '090007'), NOT with .OF suffix\n- Stock codes: .XSHG (Shanghai), .XSHE (Shenzhen)\n- 83 API functions across 9 categories\n- Skill location: /Users/fanshengxia/.claude/skills/rqdata/rqdata/\n\n**Errors encountered**:\n1. First query error: Used '090007.OF' format which is invalid - fixed by removing .OF suffix to use '090007'\n2. Skill tool invocation error: \"Unknown skill: rqdata\" - worked around by directly using skill content\n\n**Files created**:\n- SKILL.md (main skill file with workflow, code validation rules)\n- references/stock-api.md\n- references/hk-stock-api.md\n- references/futures-api.md\n- references/options-api.md\n- references/index-etf-api.md\n- references/fund-api.md\n- references/convertible-api.md\n- references/other-api.md\n- scripts/query_helper.py (code normalization helper)\n\n**Current work**: Just finished updating the skill to include auto-validation and execution workflow. The skill now emphasizes that queries must be executed automatically with results returned, not just code generation.\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   - Create a skill for RiceQuant (米筐) RQData Python database that organizes API calling methods\n   - When user asks to query data via RiceQuant, automatically execute queries and return actual data results\n   - Auto-correct and validate contract code formats (especially fund codes)\n   - Generate a comprehensive Chinese documentation about the database on the Desktop (pending task)\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - RiceQuant RQData Python SDK (rqdatac)\n   - License-based authentication using provided license key\n   - Contract code normalization (fund codes are pure numbers without .OF suffix)\n   - 83 API functions across 9 financial product categories\n   - Pandas DataFrame as primary return format\n   - Point-in-time financial data to avoid look-ahead bias\n   - Multi-frequency data support (daily/minute/tick/weekly)\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n   - `/Users/fanshengxia/.claude/skills/rqdata/rqdata/SKILL.md`\n     - Main skill configuration file\n     - Added workflow section emphasizing automatic query execution\n     - Added code format validation rules with common error patterns\n     ```yaml\n     ---\n     name: rqdata\n     description: |\n       RiceQuant (米筐) rqdatac Python金融数据库查询工具。\n       **重要：直接运行查询并返回数据结果，不仅仅生成代码。自动校验和修正代码格式。**\n     ---\n     ```\n     - Added auto-correction rules table showing fund code format: `'090007.OF' → '090007'`\n     \n   - `/Users/fanshengxia/.claude/skills/rqdata/rqdata/references/stock-api.md`\n     - A股 API reference covering financials, factors, dividends, industries, margin trading\n     - Key functions: `get_pit_financials_ex()`, `get_factor()`, `get_dividend_info()`\n     \n   - `/Users/fanshengxia/.claude/skills/rqdata/rqdata/references/fund-api.md`\n     - Fund API reference covering NAV, holdings, managers, classifications\n     - Key functions: `fund.get_nav()`, `fund.get_holdings()`, `fund.get_asset_allocation()`\n     \n   - `/Users/fanshengxia/.claude/skills/rqdata/rqdata/scripts/query_helper.py`\n     - Code normalization utility\n     ```python\n     def normalize_code(code: str, asset_type: str = 'auto') -> str:\n         \"\"\"Auto-correct contract code format\"\"\"\n         code = code.strip().upper()\n         # Fund code correction (remove .OF suffix)\n         if code.endswith('.OF'):\n             return code.replace('.OF', '')\n         # Stock/ETF code correction\n         if '.SH' in code:\n             return code.replace('.SH', '.XSHG')\n         if '.SZ' in code:\n             return code.replace('.SZ', '.XSHE')\n         return code\n     ```\n   \n   - `/Users/fanshengxia/Desktop/ricequant/RiceQuant_RQData_Python_Docs.md`\n     - Official documentation (1.4 MB, 20,932 lines)\n     - Contains all API signatures and usage examples\n     \n   - `/Users/fanshengxia/Desktop/ricequant/米筐data.py`\n     - Login example with license key\n     ```python\n     licence = \"SXF4jz91bGBpFOPY5BIycxRQHOML4u4k069mhLmeDvlZN6Nv0oqEJ_kGoejOnkaFMTOEQAAaRvu5-Xk4v9Mf8_lnKktX5vJqqaSWsHjU9D1mSi1mxcTL3sqfWgX-vCzIxeCCukipK37UB8OjzyJdoPbAZB6Gn5Pw8iuK7t5HRjU=...\"\n     rqdatac.init('license', licence)\n     ```\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - **Error: Invalid fund code format '090007.OF'**\n     - Error message: \"invalid order_book_id: 090007.OF\"\n     - Fix: Removed .OF suffix to use pure number format '090007'\n     - User feedback: Requested automatic format validation and correction in future queries\n   \n   - **Error: Skill tool invocation failed**\n     - Error: \"Unknown skill: rqdata\"\n     - Fix: Worked around by directly using skill documentation content instead of Skill tool\n   \n   - **Error: Holdings data unavailable**\n     - Fund holdings returned N/A values\n     - Explanation: Data披露延迟 or access restrictions in RiceQuant system\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - **Problem**: Fund code format inconsistency between common usage (.OF suffix) and RiceQuant format (pure numbers)\n     - **Solution**: Created normalize_code() function and documented format rules in SKILL.md\n   \n   - **Problem**: User wanted automatic query execution, not just code generation\n     - **Solution**: Updated SKILL.md with explicit workflow requiring execution via Bash tool and formatted result presentation\n   \n   - **Problem**: Organizing 83 API functions from massive documentation\n     - **Solution**: Split into 8 categorized reference files for progressive disclosure\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - \"我们公司采购了ricequant的数据库，他们的官方文档如下https://www.ricequant.com/doc/rqdata/python/index-rqdatac，我获取了官方文档的文档在当前目录下，还有登录和调用的示例，里面有我可以连接的licence，我希望你创建一下skills，整理数据库的详细调用和查询数据方式，以后我说通过ricequant 调用数据你会自己帮我从这个数据库调用数据\"\n   - \"继续\"\n   - \"通过ricequant查询090007.OF这只基金的近1年涨跌幅和最新持仓\"\n   - \"好的\"\n   - \"我希望你直接给我数据，而不是给我生成代码\"\n   - \"好的请调整skills 以后查询基金数据会自动调整格式或者校验，我问数据的情况你会帮我运作和得到数据\"\n   - \"基于这个skills和你对这个数据库的理解，总结这个数据库的调用方式，在我的桌面生成一个这个数据库的中文详细文档\" (in system reminder)\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - Generate comprehensive Chinese documentation about RiceQuant database on Desktop (`/Users/fanshengxia/Desktop/`)\n   - Documentation should summarize database calling methods based on the skill and understanding of the database\n\n8. Current Work:\n   Just completed updating the rqdata skill to include automatic code validation and query execution workflow. The skill was modified to:\n   - Add \"工作流程\" (Workflow) section emphasizing automatic execution\n   - Add \"合约代码规则与自动修正\" (Contract Code Rules and Auto-correction) section with detailed format table\n   - Create `scripts/query_helper.py` for code normalization\n   - Explicitly state in description: \"**重要：直接运行查询并返回数据结果，不仅仅生成代码。自动校验和修正代码格式。**\"\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Create a comprehensive Chinese documentation file on the Desktop summarizing the RiceQuant database calling methods. This is directly based on the user's most recent request:\n   \n   **User's exact request**: \"基于这个skills和你对这个数据库的理解，总结这个数据库的调用方式，在我的桌面生成一个这个数据库的中文详细文档\"\n   \n   The documentation should include:\n   - Database initialization and authentication\n   - Contract code formats and validation rules\n   - All 9 API categories with examples\n   - Common usage patterns\n   - Troubleshooting guide\n   - File location: `/Users/fanshengxia/Desktop/RiceQuant数据库使用文档.md`\n\nIf you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/fanshengxia/.claude/projects/-Users-fanshengxia-Desktop-ricequant/dc9450b7-2d0a-48d9-8bc1-26d7750ed97e.jsonl\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left off without asking the user any further questions.

修正格式\n    code = code.strip().upper()\n    if asset_type == 'fund' and code.endswith('.OF'):\n        code = code.replace('.OF', '')\n    elif '.SH' in code:\n        code = code.replace('.SH', '.XSHG')\n    elif '.SZ' in code:\n        code = code.replace('.SZ', '.XSHE')\n\n    # 验证代码有效性\n    try:\n        info = rqdatac.instruments(code)\n        if info is None:\n            raise ValueError(f\"无效的合约代码: {code}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"代码验证失败: {e}\")\n        return None\n\n    # 执行查询\n    return rqdatac.get_price(code, ...)\n```\n\n### 8.2 数据导出\n\n```python\n# 导出到CSV\ndf = rqdatac.get_price('000001.XSHE', '20240101', '20240110')\ndf.to_csv('000001_price.csv', encoding='utf-8-sig')\n\n# 导出到Excel\ndf.to_excel('000001_price.xlsx', sheet_name='日线行情')\n```\n\n### 8.3 分钟线与Tick数据获取建议\n\n```python\n# 推荐：单只股票+长时间段\ndf_1m = rqdatac.get_price(\n    '000001.XSHE',\n    start_date='20240101',\n    end_date='20240131',\n    frequency='1m'\n)\n\n# 不推荐：多只股票+短时间段（流量消耗更大）\ndf_1m = rqdatac.get_price(\n    ['000001.XSHE', '600000.XSHG', ...],  #

修正格式\n    code = code.strip().upper()\n    if asset_type == 'fund' and code.endswith('.OF'):\n        code = code.replace('.OF', '')\n    elif '.SH' in code:\n        code = code.replace('.SH', '.XSHG')\n    elif '.SZ' in code:\n        code = code.replace('.SZ', '.XSHE')\n\n    # 验证代码有效性\n    try:\n        info = rqdatac.instruments(code)\n        if info is None:\n            raise ValueError(f\"无效的合约代码: {code}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"代码验证失败: {e}\")\n        return None\n\n    # 执行查询\n    return rqdatac.get_price(code, ...)\n```\n\n### 8.2 数据导出\n\n```python\n# 导出到CSV\ndf = rqdatac.get_price('000001.XSHE', '20240101', '20240110')\ndf.to_csv('000001_price.csv', encoding='utf-8-sig')\n\n# 导出到Excel\ndf.to_excel('000001_price.xlsx', sheet_name='日线行情')\n```\n\n### 8.3 分钟线与Tick数据获取建议\n\n```python\n# 推荐：单只股票+长时间段\ndf_1m = rqdatac.get_price(\n    '000001.XSHE',\n    start_date='20240101',\n    end_date='20240131',\n    frequency='1m'\n)\n\n# 不推荐：多只股票+短时间段（流量消耗更大）\ndf_1m = rqdatac.get_price(\n    ['000001.XSHE', '600000.XSHG', ...],  # 100只股票\n    start_date='20240110',\n    end_date='20240110',\n    frequency='1m'\n)\n```\n\n### 8.4 防未来函数（回测必备）\n\n```python\n# 财务数据必须使用PIT接口\nfinancials = rqdatac.get_pit_financials_ex(...)\n\n# 分红数据应使用ex_dividend_date（除权除息日）而非announcement_date（公告日）\ndividend = rqdatac.get_dividend_info(...)\n# 在回测中应使用 ex_dividend_date 字段\n```\n\n### 8.5 异常处理\n\n```python\nimport rqdatac\n\ndef safe_query(order_book_id, start_date, end_date):\n    \"\"\"带异常处理的查询\"\"\"\n    try:\n        data = rqdatac.get_price(order_book_id, start_date, end_date)\n        if data is None or data.empty:\n            print(f\"警告：{order_book_id} 无数据\")\n            return None\n        return data\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"查询失败 {order_book_id}: {str(e)}\")\n        return None\n```\n\n---\n\n## 附录：快速参考卡\n\n### 连接初始化\n\n```python\nimport rqdatac\nrqdatac.init('license', licence)\n```\n\n### 常用API一览\n\n| 功能 | API | 示例 |\n|------|-----|------|\n| 日线行情 | `get_price()` | `get_price('000001.XSHE', '20240101', '20240110')` |\n| 实时快照 | `current_snapshot()` | `current_snapshot('000001.XSHE')` |\n| 合约信息 | `instruments()` | `instruments('000001.XSHE')` |\n| 交易日历 | `get_trading_dates()` | `get_trading_dates('20240101', '20240131')` |\n| A股财务 | `get_pit_financials_ex()` | `get_pit_financials_ex('000001.XSHE', ['roe'], ...)` |\n| 基金净值 | `fund.get_nav()` | `fund.get_nav('090007', ...)` |\n| 指数成分 | `index.get_weights()` | `index.get_weights('000300.XSHG', ...)` |\n| 期货主力 | `futures.get_dominant()` | `futures.get_dominant('IF', ...)` |\n| 收益率曲线 | `get_yield_curve()` | `get_yield_curve('20240101', '20240110', '10Y')` |\n\n---\n\n**文档版本**: v1.0\n**更新日期**: 2024年\n**技术支持**: https://www.ricequant.com/doc/rqdata/python/index-rqdatac\n","structuredPatch":[],"originalFile":null},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"b191592b-b516-469f-a06e-6d17764adbae"}
