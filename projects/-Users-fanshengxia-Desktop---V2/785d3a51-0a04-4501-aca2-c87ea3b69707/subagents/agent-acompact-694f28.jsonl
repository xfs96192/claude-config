First, the user triggered `/init` which asked me to analyze the codebase and create/improve a CLAUDE.md file. But since CLAUDE.md already existed, I analyzed the codebase thoroughly.\n\n2. I used multiple explore agents to understand:\n   - All Python scripts and their roles\n   - Excel template (.xlsm) with 68 sheets\n   - Word template (.docm) with 66 bookmarks\n   - VBA macro workflow\n   - Output directory structure\n   - The complete PDF report structure (40+ pages)\n\n3. I read the full PDF report (pages 1-40) to understand the exact format of the final weekly report.\n\n4. I then created a Claude Code skill at `~/.claude/skills/weekly-report/` with:\n   - SKILL.md (main skill file, ~330 lines)\n   - references/bookmark_mapping.md (Excel sheet → Word bookmark mapping)\n\n5. The skill automates 5 steps:\n   - Step 1: Update config.py date\n   - Step 2: Run Python pipeline (5 scripts)\n   - Step 3: Update Excel link workbook with openpyxl\n   - Step 4: Screenshot Excel tables\n   - Step 5: Assemble Word document and generate PDF\n\n6. Then the user asked \"请尝试一下生成2026年2月5日的周报\" (Please try generating the weekly report for February 5, 2026)\n\n7. I invoked the weekly-report skill and the skill content was loaded into context.\n\n8. I started creating task tracking items for the execution:\n   - Task 1: Check config date configuration\n   - Task 2: Check Python pipeline output\n   - Task 3: Update Excel link workbook\n\n9. The conversation was interrupted for summarization after creating 3 tasks but before actually executing any of the steps.\n\nKey technical details:\n- Project at /Users/fanshengxia/Desktop/周报V2/\n- config.py YUNZUOGAILAN_DATE at line ~46 is the master date\n- generate_report.py (~1800 lines) generates 40+ sheets\n- Excel VBA workbook: 周报生成工具_加权_调整兴动合兴系列.xlsm (68 sheets)\n- Word template: 多资产投资部产品周报-模版.docm (66 bookmarks)\n- 6 external file links tracked in 链接数据表 sheet\n- 书签表 sheet maps Excel sheets → Word bookmarks\n- Output goes to 输出结果/ directory\n- The report date 20260205 was already configured (config.py already has this date)\n- The output file 输出结果20260205.xlsx likely already exists since this date was previously configured\n\nErrors:\n- When trying to Write SKILL.md the first time, got \"File has not been read yet\" error - fixed by reading first then writing\n- PDF read with pages \"20-40\" failed due to max 20 pages limit - fixed by using \"21-40\"\n\nUser messages (non-tool):\n1. `/init` command to create CLAUDE.md\n2. \"请尝试一下生成2026年2月5日的周报\" - asking to try generating the weekly report for Feb 5, 2026\n</analysis>\n\n<summary>\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   - **Initial request**: The user ran `/init` to analyze the codebase and create/improve CLAUDE.md. Since CLAUDE.md already existed and was comprehensive, the focus shifted to creating a weekly-report automation skill.\n   - **Skill creation**: Created a Claude Code skill (`weekly-report`) that automates the end-to-end weekly report generation for 兴银理财多资产投资部 (Xingyin Wealth Management Multi-Asset Investment Department).\n   - **Current request**: User asked \"请尝试一下生成2026年2月5日的周报\" — to actually execute the skill and generate the weekly report for date 20260205. This is the active task that was just started.\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - **Project location**: `/Users/fanshengxia/Desktop/周报V2/`\n   - **Config master date**: `config.py` line ~46, `YUNZUOGAILAN_DATE = '20260205'` drives all other dates\n   - **Python pipeline**: 5 sequential scripts: `move_files.py` → `update_new_product_catgoery.py` → `generate_report.py` → `calculate_all_benchmarks.py` → `yield_forecast.py`\n   - **Orchestrator**: `run_weekly_report.py` runs all 5 steps with user confirmation\n   - **Excel VBA workbook**: `周报生成工具_加权_调整兴动合兴系列.xlsm` (68 sheets) — uses VLOOKUP formulas referencing 6 external Excel files by date\n   - **Word template**: `多资产投资部产品周报-模版.docm` (66 bookmarks) — VBA inserts tables as images + AI text\n   - **链接数据表 sheet**: Tracks 6 external file references (old path → new path)\n   - **书签表 sheet**: Maps Excel sheet names → Word bookmark names\n   - **NAV caching**: `.nav_cache/` directory with parquet format, reduces load time from ~30min to seconds\n   - **AI integration**: DeepSeek API generates 3 summary texts (规模/中收/到期)\n   - **Market data**: Wind API via `market_data_provider.py` singleton\n   - **Output**: `输出结果/输出结果{DATE}.xlsx` (40+ sheets) → Excel VBA workbook → Word/PDF report\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n   - **`/Users/fanshengxia/Desktop/周报V2/CLAUDE.md`** — Project instructions file, already comprehensive (213 lines). Read to understand current documentation.\n   - **`/Users/fanshengxia/Desktop/周报V2/config.py`** — Central config. `YUNZUOGAILAN_DATE` at line ~46 currently set to `'20260205'`. All other dates auto-calculated.\n   - **`/Users/fanshengxia/Desktop/周报V2/generate_report.py`** — Main report generation (~1800 lines). Grepped for `to_excel|sheet_name|ExcelWriter` to map all 40+ output sheets.\n   - **`/Users/fanshengxia/Desktop/周报V2/流程.md`** — Workflow document (13 steps), read to understand manual workflow that skill replaces.\n   - **`/Users/fanshengxia/Desktop/周报V2/run_weekly_report.py`** — Orchestrator script for steps 1-5.\n   - **`/Users/fanshengxia/.claude/skills/weekly-report/SKILL.md`** — Created. 330-line skill file covering 5-step automation:\n     - Step 1: Parse date, update config.py\n     - Step 2: Run Python pipeline (5 scripts)\n     - Step 3: Update Excel link workbook via openpyxl (replace date strings in VLOOKUP formulas)\n     - Step 4: Screenshot Excel tables via Playwright\n     - Step 5: Assemble Word doc via python-docx + generate PDF\n   - **`/Users/fanshengxia/.claude/skills/weekly-report/references/bookmark_mapping.md`** — Created. Complete mapping of 66 bookmarks across categories: Dates/Text (6), Section一 (9), Maturity (3), Performance (12), Assets (14), Product Series (27). Also documents the 6 external file links.\n   - **`/Users/fanshengxia/.claude/projects/-Users-fanshengxia-Desktop---V2/memory/MEMORY.md`** — Updated with skill creation notes and project architecture summary.\n   - **PDF analyzed**: `/Users/fanshengxia/Desktop/周报V2/输出结果/多资产投资部产品周报-20260205.pdf` — Read all 40 pages to understand exact report structure (3 major sections, ~40 tables/charts).\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - **PDF page range error**: Tried to read pages \"20-40\" but max is 20 pages per request. Fixed by reading \"21-40\" instead.\n   - **File not read before write error**: When writing SKILL.md, got \"File has not been read yet\" error because the init script created it but I hadn't read it. Fixed by reading the template SKILL.md first, then writing.\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - **Solved**: Created comprehensive skill to automate the full weekly report pipeline, replacing manual VBA operations with Python-based automation (openpyxl for Excel link updates, Playwright for screenshots, python-docx for Word assembly).\n   - **Solved**: Documented all 66 Word bookmarks and their corresponding Excel sheet sources in references/bookmark_mapping.md.\n   - **Design decision**: Steps 4-5 (screenshot + Word assembly) are designed but not yet battle-tested in real execution — noted in memory.\n   - **Ongoing**: Actually executing the skill for date 20260205 — just started, created 3 tracking tasks.\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - `/init` command — triggered CLAUDE.md analysis and codebase exploration\n   - \"请尝试一下生成2026年2月5日的周报\" — requested actual execution of the weekly report generation for 20260205\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - **Task #1 (pending)**: 步骤1: 检查config日期配置 — Confirm config.py has YUNZUOGAILAN_DATE = '20260205'\n   - **Task #2 (pending)**: 步骤2: 检查Python管线输出 — Verify 输出结果20260205.xlsx exists with all key sheets\n   - **Task #3 (pending)**: 步骤3: 更新Excel链接工作簿 — Use openpyxl to update date references in VBA workbook\n   - Steps 4-5 (screenshot + Word/PDF assembly) not yet created as tasks\n\n8. Current Work:\n   The user asked \"请尝试一下生成2026年2月5日的周报\" and I invoked the `weekly-report` skill, which loaded the full skill instructions. I then created 3 TaskCreate items to track progress:\n   - Task #1: 步骤1: 检查config日期配置\n   - Task #2: 步骤2: 检查Python管线输出\n   - Task #3: 步骤3: 更新Excel链接工作簿\n   \n   I had NOT yet started executing any actual steps. The next action would be to begin Task #1 by reading config.py to verify the date is already set to 20260205.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Begin executing Task #1 — read config.py to check if `YUNZUOGAILAN_DATE` is already set to `'20260205'`. Since this date was the last configured date (visible in git status showing current config), it likely already is correct. Then proceed to Task #2 to verify the Python output file `输出结果/输出结果20260205.xlsx` exists and contains all required sheets (since the Python pipeline was likely already run for this date previously). The user's exact request was: \"请尝试一下生成2026年2月5日的周报\" — try generating the Feb 5, 2026 weekly report. I was about to start Task #1 (checking config).\n</summary>"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1319,"cache_read_input_tokens":166977,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":1319},"output_tokens":5,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CXviSBeFBd72CXoSG3yB2","type":"assistant","uuid":"c28e0d35-9b7c-4e99-946c-e62e482345a4","timestamp":"2026-02-08T13:55:31.521Z"}
